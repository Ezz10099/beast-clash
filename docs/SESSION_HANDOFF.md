## Current Session Goal

Record native APK acceptance and define a commercially credible medium launch scope before expanding the game.

## Completed This Session

- Reviewed every repository in the owner's GitHub account.
- Selected Pixel Mage as the only active project until Google Play testing.
- Replaced the single encounter with five escalating waves and a final boss.
- Added three upgrade choices between waves.
- Added score and locally persisted best score.
- Added `npm run check` with an automated five-wave flow test.
- Added permanent scope and workflow guidance.
- Replaced the touch buttons with drag movement and automatic casting.
- Added a compact Pause/Options overlay with resume and restart.
- Added persistent sound and haptic toggles.
- Added automatic safe pause on focus loss or app switching.
- Added an original synthesized feedback sound set and event-based haptics.
- Polished the arena, mage, spell, slime variants, panels, and first-screen instructions.
- Extended automated checks across controls, pause freezing, auto-pause, settings persistence, audio initialization, haptics, upgrades, boss behavior, and the complete run.
- Added a deterministic `dist/` build with an explicit three-file runtime whitelist.
- Added a checksum and byte-count manifest for the exact release bundle.
- Proved the bundle has no network dependency or legacy Beast Clash runtime file.
- Expanded automated reliability coverage to ten complete five-wave runs.
- Added hard caps for bolts and particles to prevent runaway runtime growth.
- Added compact responsive layouts for short and small portrait screens.
- Added release-bundle size, safe-area, viewport, checksum, and content checks.
- Froze the accepted web release candidate on `web-rc-0.1.0`.
- Added pinned Capacitor 8 core, Android, App, CLI, esbuild, and artwork-generation dependencies.
- Created the native Android project with package ID `com.ezz10099.pixelmage`.
- Locked portrait orientation, API 24 minimum, API 36 target, and offline-only permissions.
- Added native app switching and Android Back behavior.
- Created original vector-based Pixel Mage launcher and splash artwork with deterministic PNG generation.
- Added a GitHub Actions workflow with read-only content access that builds and uploads a debug APK.
- Added Android identity, artwork, workflow, permission, and version checks.
- Added narrow commit-status reporting so cloud builds can be monitored safely through the connected GitHub tools.
- Completed cloud build run `29180335240` successfully and verified its uploaded APK artifact and digest.
- Added `docs/START_HERE.md` as the permanent cross-session entry point.
- Added `docs/DECISIONS.md` so locked choices are not repeatedly reopened.
- Added `docs/GOOGLE_PLAY.md` to preserve the beginner-friendly APK, Capacitor, AAB, testing, and publication path.
- Extended the roadmap beyond the APK through release readiness, signing, AAB, Play testing, and production.
- Added a mandatory session-closing protocol to keep the handoff and roadmap current.
- The owner installed the first debug APK and confirmed that it passed: no bugs were observed and everything tested worked.
- The owner reported that the complete current run lasts roughly one minute.
- Reclassified the current native build as a validated vertical slice while the commercial launch scope is reconsidered.

## Phone Validation Result

The user accepted the gameplay/control, release-experience, and web-release-candidate batches through SPCK. On July 13, 2026, the user also installed and accepted the native APK with no reported bugs. Milestone 7 is complete.

## Current Development Objective

The Android route is validated. Do not proceed directly to store preparation and do not treat the one-minute build as commercially complete. The next major decision is to approve a capped medium launch scope between the tiny vertical slice and a large multi-world RPG.

## Next Session Entry Point

Start by reading `AGENTS.md` and `docs/START_HERE.md`. Review the proposed medium commercial scope with the owner and obtain explicit approval for exact limits on heroes, worlds, story, progression systems, run duration, and total launch depth. Then update the release scope and durable decisions before implementing one substantial expansion batch.

At the end of the next meaningful session, update this file with the new commit, phone-test result, blockers, and one exact continuation step.

## Verification

Run:

`npm run check`

Current expected result:

`Pixel Mage checks passed: 10 complete runs.`

`Release bundle checks passed (... runtime bytes).`

`Android configuration checks passed.`
